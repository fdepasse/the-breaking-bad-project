## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
This was the second project from the Software Engineering Immersive Course I took at General Assembly London, built after 6 weeks of class.

It was a **pair programming** project in the form of a **2 days** Hackathon.

The application is a tribute to the Breaking Bad series allowing visitors to look at various artistic illustrations of the show, browse the characters and the episodes.

It is a frontend application built with React JS and talking to a Public API, implementing AJAX principles with JavaScript. It has been deployed via GitHub.

## <a name="approach"></a>Approach
### Step 1: Building the board
<p align="center"><img src="images/grid.png"></p>

#### Problem #1: Programatically generating a 18 x 18 square grid via DOM Manipulation
I used a **for loop** to create all the cells. I gave each of them an innerHTML (useful for debugging), an id (extensively used during the course of the game for the characters’ positions) and dimensions. I also pushed all cells to an array for future use.

```
for (let i = 0; i < gridWidth ** 2; i++) {
  const newCell = document.createElement(‘div’)
  grid.appendChild(newCell)
  newCell.innerHTML = i
  newCell.id = i
  newCell.style.width = `${100 / gridWidth}%`
  newCell.style.height = `${100 / gridWidth}%`
  allCells.push(newCell)
}
```
<br/>

#### Problem #2: Giving each cell the right class to represent "stones", "dots", "moons" and "tunnels"
I chose to store my cells by type within an object of arrays, each key being a cell type taking an array of cells as value as per below.

``` 
const cellsObject = {
stones: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 162, 180, 198, 216, 234, 252, 270, 288, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 305, 287, 269, 251, 233, 215, 197, 179, 143, 125, 107, 89, 71, 53, 35, 26, 44, 62, 63, 45, 27, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 114, 132, 134, 135, 153, 152, 137, 119, 139, 140, 141, 142, 127, 128, 129, 130, 168, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 173, 175, 193, 194, 176, 177, 195, 196, 178, 163, 181, 164, 182, 165, 183, 166, 184, 206, 207, 225, 224, 222, 220, 219, 218, 236, 237, 238, 240, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 245, 227, 229, 247, 248, 230, 231, 249, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285],
  dots: [291, 292, 290, 289, 293, 294, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 268, 267, 266, 265, 264, 257, 256, 254, 255, 253, 235, 217, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 221, 239, 204, 205, 223, 226, 208, 209, 210, 228, 246, 211, 212, 213, 214, 232, 250, 185, 185, 167, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 131, 113, 112, 111, 109, 110, 91, 73, 55, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 43, 61, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 64, 46, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 70, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 106, 124, 123, 122, 121, 120, 138, 156, 174, 192, 157, 158, 159, 160],
  moons: [37, 52, 271, 286],
  tunnelright: 161,
  tunnelleft: 144
}
```
I then created a function to loop through each array in `cellsObject` and give each cell the relevant class on the board.

```
function giveClassToCells(array, className) {
  array.forEach((element) => {
    selectCellId(element).classList.add(className)
  })
}
giveClassToCells(cellsObject.stones, 'stone')
```

### Step 2: Creating the characters
<p align="center"><img src="images/characters.png"></p>

#### <a name="position"></a>Problem #1: Storing information about the characters so it can be easily accessed to manipulate the DOM
I created a class of `Character` taking the following properties common to all characters: `charName` (a CSS class of the character), `startPosition` (a cell id number to know where to make the characters appear on the grid at first) and `position` (the cell id position where the character currently is at any point during the game).

```
class Character {
  constructor(charName, startPosition) {
    this.charName = charName
    this.startPosition = startPosition
    this.position = ''
  }
}
```

<br/>

#### <a name="char-spec"></a> Problem #2: Capturing each character specificities
For Michael, I needed an extra key-value pair to be able to change Michael's status between "Normal" and "Werewolf" depending if the Full Moon mode was activated or not. I have created an extension of the Character class to a class of Hero so I could add the status of Michael (mj = normal mode / mj-werewolf = full moon mode).

```
class Hero extends Character {
  constructor(charName, startPosition) {
    super(charName, startPosition)
    this.status = 'mj'
  }
}
```
For the zombies, I have stored the 4 objects in an array so I could manage their behaviour all at once by [looping through them](#zombies). 

```
const zombies = []
const zombMexican = new Character('mexican-zombie', 115)
const zombOffice = new Character('office-zombie', 118)
const zombNews = new Character('news-zombie', 169)
const zombPirate = new Character('pirate-zombie', 172)
zombies.push(zombMexican, zombOffice, zombNews, zombPirate)
```

<br/>

<hr/>

### Step 3: The Gameplay
#### <a name="variables"></a>Problem #1: Keeping track of the lives, the points scored, the full moon and pop corn modes
As these variables change during the game, they trigger specific events. Therefore, it was important to be able to check their status at all time. For this reason, I have stored them in global variables:

* `lives` set to 3 by default and decreases when Michael gets caught by zombies
* `points` set to 0 to start with and updates as the player eats dots, moons, pop corn and zombies when in Full Moon mode
* `fullMoon` set to false by default and switches to true when Michael lands on a moon
* `popCornTime` set to 0 by default and switches to 1 when 400 and 800 points are scored

<p align="center"><img src="images/variables.png"></p>


#### <a name="michael"></a>Problem #2: Moving Michael with the arrow keys of the keyboard, managing his behaviour and his impact on the game depending on the situation he encounters
Michael’s movements have been wrapped under a function called `michaelMoves()`. It listens to "keyup" events on the keyboard and returns the relevant set of behaviours depending on whether the key pressed is "up", "right", "down" or "left" (managed with an if statement). 

When a key is pressed:

* An interval running the code every 300ms allows Michael to move on his own
* If statements constantly check `michael.position` (property of `michael` [object](#position)) and his next move
* Depending on the type of cell he is landing on, the relevant logic is applied
* Points scoring is captured in this statement

```
function michaelMoves() {

  document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
    const keyPressed = event.key

    if (keyPressed === 'ArrowRight') {
      clearInterval(michaelInterval)
      michaelInterval = setInterval(() => {
        removeMichael()
        if (michael.position === cellsObject.tunnelright) {
          michael.position = cellsObject.tunnelleft
          selectCellId(cellsObject.tunnelleft).classList.add(michael.status)
        } else if (selectCellId(michael.position + 1).classList.contains('stone')) {
          selectCellId(michael.position).classList.add(michael.status)
        } else if (selectCellId(michael.position + 1).classList.contains('dot')) {
          michael.position++
          selectCellId(michael.position).classList.add(michael.status)
          selectCellId(michael.position).classList.remove('dot')
          points += 10
          displayScore.innerHTML = points
...
      }, 300)
    }
```

<br/>

#### <a name="zombies"></a>Problem #3: Moving the Zombies randomly on the grid, managing their behaviour and their impact on the game depending on the situation they encounter
* I have used a `forEach` loop on the zombies array set in [Step 2](#char-spec) in order to run the same code on all 4 zombies
* The loop is wrapped in a interval allowing the characters to change direction every 300ms

```
    const gameInterval = setInterval(() => {
...
      zombies.forEach((zombie) => {
```

* I have stored all possible direction the zombies can take in a `zombieDirectionArray` array and I am then calculating and storing the characters next move in a variable `randomDirection`

`const randomDirection = zombieDirectionArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * zombieDirectionArray.length)]`

* If statements check first if the full moon mode is on or not and then the relevant logic applies depending on what cell each zombie land on
* The collision detection with Michael happens in this code block and the relevant logic happens if the full moon mode is on or not

```
...
 if (fullMoon === false) {
          if (zombie.position === michael.position) {
            clearInterval(gameInterval)
            removeMichael()
            selectCellId(zombie.position).classList.add(zombie.charName, 'zombie')
            lives--
            displayLives[lives].setAttribute('src', 'images/lives-lost.png')
            if (lives > 0) {
              setTimeout(() => {
                removeAllZombies()
              }, 1000)
              setTimeout(() => {
                allCells.forEach((cell) => {
                  cell.classList.remove(michael.status)
                })
                michaelToStartPosition()
                zombiesToStartPosition()
              }, 1000)
              playGame()
            } else {
              gameOver()
            }
...
```

<br/>

#### Problem #4: Implementing the Full Moon mode
##### Dealing with Michael's side of things in the `michaelMoves()` function


* When Michael lands on a "moon" it switches [`fullMoon`](#variables) to `true` if the full moon mode is not already on
* [`michael.status`](#char-spec) changes to `mj-werewolf` and allows Michael to turn into a Werewolf
* The appearance of the whole page changes
* A `setTimeout` make sure the full moon mode ends after 10s and that Michael and the page appearance return to normal mode

```
...
else if (selectCellId(michael.position + 1).classList.contains('moon')) {
          michael.position++
          selectCellId(michael.position).classList.add(michael.status)
          selectCellId(michael.position).classList.remove('moon')
          points += 50
          displayScore.innerHTML = points
          if (fullMoon === false) {
            fullMoon = true
            removeMichael()
            michael.status = 'mj-werewolf'
            selectCellId(michael.position).classList.add(michael.status)
            logo.setAttribute('src', 'images/full-moon.png')
            logo.setAttribute('alt', 'Full Moon')
            logo.style.width = '20%'
            logo.style.padding = '0 0 7.5% 0'
            setTimeout(() => {
              removeMichael()
              fullMoon = false
              michael.status = 'mj'
              selectCellId(michael.position).classList.add(michael.status)
              logo.setAttribute('src', 'images/thriller-logo.png')
              logo.setAttribute('alt', 'Thriller Logo')
              logo.style.width = '50%'
            }, 10000)
          }
...
```
<p align="center"><img src="images/mj-werewolf-small.png"></p>

##### Dealing with the zombies' side of things in the [`forEach`](#zombies) loop
* Michael as a werewolf can eat the zombies and score 200 points in the process 
* Zombies enter scared mode and take a class of “zombie-scared” which makes them shake
* Once eaten, Zombies appear back on their starting position after 5s

```
if (fullMoon === true) {
          //  What happens if Zombies encounter Michael Werewolf
          if (zombie.position === michael.position) {
            selectCellId(zombie.position).classList.remove(zombie.charName, 'zombie-scared')
            zombie.position = zombie.startPosition
            points += 200
            displayScore.innerHTML = points
            setTimeout(() => {
              selectCellId(zombie.position).classList.add(zombie.charName, 'zombie-scared')
            }, 5000)
```

<br/>

#### Problem #5: Implementing the Pop Corn mode
* Once 400 and 800 points have been reached a “Pop - Corn” bonus appear randomly on the board. If eaten by Michael it gives an extra 100 points to the player
<p align="center"><img src="images/pop-corn-small.png"></p>

* When points reaches 400 and 800 points, an if statement increment `popCornTime` to 1 and calls the function `popCornMode()`

```
      if (points === 400 || points === 800) {
        popCornTime++
        popCornMode()
      }
```

* `popCornMode()` gets a random location on the grid (calling `popCornRandomLocation()`) for the pop corn to appear and set the class of Pop Corn on the selected cell
* A `setTimeout` ensures the mode lasts 10s only 

``` javascript
function popCornMode() {
  if (popCornTime === 1) {
    popCornRandomLocation()
    selectCellId(popCornPosition).classList.add('pop-corn')
    return setTimeout(() => {
      selectCellId(popCornPosition).classList.remove('pop-corn')
      popCornTime = 0
    }, 10000)
  }
}
```

<br/>


### Step 4: Bringing it all together
#### Problem #1: Running the game
* A `playGame()` function runs the entire game
* `setTimeout` are in place to ensure music and game start playing after a few seconds it [started](#start)
* The game runs on a 300ms interval which allows to make the zombies move, check if the pop corn mode needs to be activated and if the game should carry on running or stop (game [won](#win) or [lost](#lose))

```
function playGame() {

  setTimeout(() => {
    audioPlayer.src = 'sounds/beat.m4a'
    audioPlayer.loop = 'loop'
    audioPlayer.play()
  }, 1130)

  setTimeout(() => {

    const gameInterval = setInterval(() => {
      gameWon(gameInterval)
...
    }, 300)
  }, 2000)
}
```

<br/>

#### <a name="start"></a>Problem #2: Starting the game
* The game starts when the “Start Game” button is clicked by calling the `playGame()` function within an event listener
* The `playGame()`  function is called 3 seconds after the button is clicked leaving time for the intro music to play and for the grid and characters to appear, all being managed with timeouts
* [`michaelMoves()`](#michael) function is also called at this point

```
document.querySelector('#start').addEventListener('click', () => {
  audioPlayer.src = 'sounds/intro.m4a'
  audioPlayer.play()
  setTimeout(() => {
    giveClassToCells(cellsObject.dots, 'dot')
    giveClassToCells(cellsObject.moons, 'moon')
  }, 2300)
  setTimeout(() => {
    zombiesToStartPosition()
    michaelToStartPosition()
    michaelMoves()
    playGame()
  }, 3000)
})
```
<br/>

#### <a name="win"></a>Problem #3: Winning the game
* `gameWon(gameInterval)` is called within the [`playGame()`](#start) function at the start of each interval
* I passed the `gameInterval` as argument so it can be cleared within the function
* The function itself check if any dots or moons are left on the board and if not the game is won, the winning screen appears

```
function gameWon(intervalName) {
  if (areDotOrMoonsLeft() === false) {
    clearInterval(intervalName)
    audioPlayer.src = 'sounds/game-won.m4a'
    audioPlayer.loop = ''
    audioPlayer.play()
    grid.style.display = 'none'
    displayResult.style.display = 'flex'
    displayResultTitle.innerHTML = 'Congratulations, you moonwalked this!'
    displayResultImage.setAttribute('src', 'images/mj-happy.png')
    displayResultImage.setAttribute('alt', 'Michael Jackson Happy')
    displayFinalScore.innerHTML = `You scored ${points} points`
    logo.setAttribute('src', 'images/thriller-logo.png')
    logo.setAttribute('alt', 'Thriller Logo')
    logo.style.width = '50%'
  }
}
```
<p align="center"><img src="images/winning-screen.png"></p>
<br/>

#### <a name="lose"></a>Problem #4: Losing the game
* The zombies loop checks how many lives are left and calls the `gameOver()` function when none are left (see [code block](#zombies) above)
* The `gameOver()` function make the losing screen appear and stops the game

```
function gameOver() {
  audioPlayer.src = 'sounds/game-over.m4a'
  audioPlayer.loop = ''
  audioPlayer.play()
  grid.style.display = 'none'
  displayResult.style.display = 'flex'
  displayResultTitle.innerHTML = 'Game Over'
  displayResultImage.setAttribute('src', 'images/mj-zombie.png')
  displayResultImage.setAttribute('alt', 'Zombie Michael Jackson')
  displayFinalScore.innerHTML = `You scored ${points} points`
}
```
<p align="center"><img src="images/losing-screen.png"></p>

## <a name="enhancements"></a>Enhancements
### Remaining Bugs
The collision detection within Michael and the Zombies is not perfect. Sometimes Michael can go through the zombies.

<br/>

### Potential Future Enhancements
* Enhanced collision management between Michael, zombies and between the 4 zombies
* Smart zombies that will track Michael using path finding algorithm
* Different behaviour for each zombie
* Zombies not moving all at the same time when the game start
* Scoreboard using local storage
* Mobile responsiveness
* Multiple grids and levels
* Multiple bonus items in addition to pop corn
* Cumulative points when eating zombies

<br/>
